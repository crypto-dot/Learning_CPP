C++ Lambda expressions

*What is a lambda expression?
-Motivation
-Review of function objects (functors)
-Relation between lambdas and function objects
*Structure of a lambda expression
*Type of lambda expressions
-Stateless lambda expressions
-Stateful lambda expression (capturing context)
*Lambdas and the STL

*Prior to C++11:
-Function objects
-Function pointers

*We often write many short functions that control algorithms
*These short functions would be encapsulated in small class to produce function objects
*Many times the classes and functions are far removed from where they are used leading to modification,maintenance, and testing issues
*Compiler cannot effectively inline these functions for efficiency

ex. 1.
Class Multiplier {
    public:
    Multiplier(uint64_t num) : num {num}{}
    uint64_t operator(const uint64_t &num) const{
        return
    }

    private:
    uint64_t num;
};
