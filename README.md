# Learning_CPP

Practicing and learning with CPP

## Purpose

I made this repositiory to track my progress learning CPP. I sometimes come back here when I forget a concept in C++. Most of the notes are not in Markdown. I am currently working on making them in Markdown because quite honestly .txt files are just ugly to read and are an unorganized mess. At the time when I created this repository I had no idea what Markdown was or how to even use it (madness I know). I plan to add a DS and Algo section.
