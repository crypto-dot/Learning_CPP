# Learning_CPP

Practicing and learning with CPP

## Purpose

I made this repositiory to track my progress learning CPP. I sometimes come back here when I forget a concept in C++. Most of the notes are not in Markdown. I am currently working on making them in Markdown because quite honestly .txt files are just ugly to read and are an unorganized mess. I plan to add a DS and Algo section which will be dedicated to learning algorithms and data structures.
